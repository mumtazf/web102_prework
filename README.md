## Notes

### Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I found the overall prework challenge to be fun especially because it seemed more gamified. I initially struggled with template literals because I thought they are more complicated than they actually are. I found it interesting to learn about reduce and filter functions because they reduce so much of the for loop process. Overall, the prework was informative and helped me further build JS skills along the way.

Currently, I'm tackling the optional challenge on search functionality. I was using a simple html form from users to search for a game, but the page refreshes each time the form is submitted. I changed my approach to searching while the query is being typed but that doesn't work because it gives me a function not defined error. I'm trying to work more on the search section.
